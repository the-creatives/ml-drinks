# ml-drinks

[Drink Detector](https://ml-drinks.herokuapp.com/) recognizes alcohol (bottles, cans, solo cups, etc.) in photographs. [We](https://github.com/the-creatives/) integrated it with Facebook to help individuals flag potentially unflattering images that they're tagged in. Of course, a Facebook image stream is just one of many places the underlying neural network can be used to perform large-scale content filtering. Drink Detector could easily be integrated with any image search service like Shutterstock to help people find what they're looking for, or used to filter an Instagram or Tumblr feed.

Training the underlying neural network was a cinch with indico's [Custom Collections](https://indico.io/product/custom-collections) - it only took us a few hours to start seeing good performance.
